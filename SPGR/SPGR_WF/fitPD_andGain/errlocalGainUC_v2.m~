% # estimation of the coils bias. we try to fit the different bias so:
% 1. all coil will have the same pd -->  PD=Coil_data/Coil_Bias
% 2. the different coils should not gain corrlation after removing the pd
% from all of them. becouse grater coralation mean adding bias part that
% will exsist in all coils and therefor pd estimations
%
% InPuts:
% x     - are the polynomials coeficient for each coil 
% his is a 2D matrix ( coeficient X coils )  
%
% box   -  is the coils data we fit to (2d (coils X data) (box is about 20^3x10).
%
% Poly  - are the polynomials we multipal the coeficient with
%
% coefdat -  coralation coeficient of the input coil by coil data ( in box).
%
% use - the location of the usiable data along the box (this is brain mask and clean for  out layers).
