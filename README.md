# mrQ #
**mrQ** is a software package designed to calculate MR parameters (T1 and PD) using spoiled gradient echo scans (SPGR, FLASH). Using T1 and PD maps, mrQ performs the evaluation of macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) and the apparent volume of the interacting water protons (VIP) as well as the water-surface interaction rate (SIR). This is **version 2** of the mrQ software package.

### Versions ###
##### Version 1 #####
Version 1 (v.1) is the code that was used by Mezer et al. in their [Nature Medicine article](http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v19/n12/full/nm.3390.html?WT.ec_id=NM-201312) (2013). The code is available at: https://github.com/mezera/mrQ/tree/v1.0

##### Version 2 #####
Version 2 (v.2) was released in autumn 2015 and was developed by the [Mezer lab](http://elsc.huji.ac.il/mezer/home) of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, in collaboration with the [VISTA lab](https://vistalab.stanford.edu/) of Stanford University, USA.
