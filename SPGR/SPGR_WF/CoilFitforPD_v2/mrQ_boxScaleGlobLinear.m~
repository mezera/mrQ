%we will right a minimization eqation so all the scalares thogther will be adjasted.
%the idea is  box(i) -box(j)*scaler equal 0. we will build such set of eqations for all
%the overlap boxes and solve them thogther in the end.
% one box will be a refernce box.
%in the case of the reference we deside that scaler is 1;

%% Build the linear equations to solve for the XXX with respect to one box.

% We have removed the coil sensitivity from each of the boxes before
% getting here.  The only difference between the boxes is the unknown scale
% factor, which we created above and stored in ScaleMat.

% Therfore, the relationship between the data in the boxes is, say,
%
%   box1 = s12*box2, and perhaps box1 = s1J*boxJ
%
% We do not have an sij for every box relationship, but we do have it for
% many and an interlocking set of boxes.
%
% So, to solve for the sij given the boxes, we can set up the linear
% equation
%
%   N*box1 = \sum_j s1j*boxj

% where the sum is over all the boxes that overlap with box 1.
