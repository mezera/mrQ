%
% function analyzes the polynomial order needed for different size boxes
%
%Inputs:
% nSamples                 nmber of voxel around the center voxal.
% sampleLocation        location of central voxel. posibale location are peaked and number 1:5is used to chose betwwn them
% nCoils                        the number of coils
% nDims                        1, 2 or 3 for the dimention of the problem
% pOrder                       the polyoms order to fit to the problem 1 2 3
% noiseRange                 a value of the M0 under we thing the SNR is too low
% plotImage                     make an image defult false
%
%       Output:
% OutPut                    is a stracture that include this fielled

%  We evaluate the percent error in the polynomial approximation for each
%
%  combination of box size and polynomial order.
%
%  We will use this to justify our choice of polynomial order and box size.
%
%  It appears that nSamples =5 and pOrder = 2 is a good choice that
%  provides a polynomial accuracy to about 1.2 percent precision.
%  We only improve to 0.76 percent when we go to pOrder = 3, which adds 10
%  more parameters.
%
%  N.B.  We only evaluate the error when the M0 is at least 500.  We know
%  that the data are very noisy at levels below this (M0 ranges up to
%  3000). So, this number is good for the coil intensities within
