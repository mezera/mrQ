# mrQ #
**mrQ** is a software package designed to calculate MR parameters (T1 and PD) using spoiled gradient echo scans (SPGR, FLASH). Using T1 and PD maps, mrQ performs the evaluation of macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) and the apparent volume of the interacting water protons (VIP) as well as the water-surface interaction rate (SIR). This is **version 2.1** of the mrQ software package.
